The algebra of observables in quantum theory plays a fundamental
role. When classical systems are quantized, their classical
symmetry algebra acting on a set of physical observables, in
simplest examples, remains the same. For some completely
integrable non-linear models, consistent quantization requires
that the classical symmetry group be replaced by a quantum group
\cite{frt,drinfeld,woronowicz,manin} via a deformation parameter
$q = 1 + O(\hbar)$. In recent years quantum groups involving
fermions have received widespread attention. These include
deformed fermion algebras \cite{jx,xh,sm,chung}, spin chains
\cite{nt,gppr,bnnpsw} and Fermi gases \cite{ubriaco}. At the same
time, some quantum systems, most notably fermionic quantum systems
do not have any classical analogues. Nevertheless, fermions are
perhaps the most important sector of quantum phenomena. Motivated
by these considerations, we define a fermionic version of the
angular momentum algebra by the relations \pagebreak \bea
\anti{J_1}{J_2} & = & J_3 \label{eqn:defrel1} \\
\anti{J_2}{J_3} & = & J_1 \label{eqn:defrel2} \\
\anti{J_3}{J_1} & = & J_2 \label{eqn:defrel3} \eea where $J_1$,
$J_2$, $J_3$ are hermitian generators of the algebra. We will name
this algebra ACSA, the anticommutator spin algebra. In these
expressions the curly bracket denotes the anticommutator \beq
\anti{A}{B} \equiv AB + BA \eeq so
(\ref{eqn:defrel1}-\ref{eqn:defrel3}) should be taken as the
definition of an associative algebra. This proposed algebra does
not fall into the category of superalgebras in the sense of
Berezin-Kac axioms. In particular, the algebra is consistent
without grading and there are no (graded) Jacobi relations. As it
is defined this algebra falls into the category of a
(non-exceptional) Jordan algebra where the Jordan product is
defined by: \beq A \circ B \equiv \frac12 (AB + BA) \quad . \eeq A
formal Jordan algebra, in addition to a commutative Jordan
product, also satisfies $A^2\circ(B\circ A) = (A^2\circ B)\circ
A$. When the Jordan product is given in terms of an anticommutator
this relation is automatically satisfied. Just as a Lie algebra
where the Lie bracket as defined by the commutator leads to an
enveloping associative algebra, a Jordan algebra defined in terms
of the above product leads to an enveloping associative algebra
which we consider as an algebra of observables.

The physical properties of this system turn out to be similar to
those of the angular momentum algebra yet exhibit remarkable
differences. Since the angular momentum algebra is used to
describe various internal symmetries, ACSA could be relevant in
describing those symmetries.

In section 2 we will show that ACSA is invariant under the action
of the quantum group $SO_q(3)$ with $q=-1$. Here, $SO_q(3)$ is
defined as the quantum subgroup of $SU_q(3)$ where each of the
(non-commuting) matrix elements of the $3$x$3$ matrix is
hermitian. We note that this defines a quantum group only for
$q=\pm1$. For $q=1$ one has the real orthogonal group $SO(3)$.

In section 3, we will construct all representations of ACSA and
show that the representations can be labelled by a quantum number
$j$ corresponding to the eigenvalue of $J_3$ whose absolute value
is maximum. For integer $j$, spectrum of $J_3$ is given by $j,
j-1, \ldots, -j$ whereas for half-integer $j$ there are two
representations. These two representations are such that for $j =
2k\pm\frac12$ spectrum of $J_3$ is respectively given by $j, j-2,
\ldots, \pm\frac12$ and $-j, j+2, \ldots, \mp\frac12$. Section 4
is reserved for conclusions and discussion.

\section{The invariance quantum group $SO_q(3)$, $q= -1$}

In order to find the invariance quantum group of this algebra, we
transform the generators $J_i$ to $J'_i$ by: \beq \label{trans}
J'_i = \sum_j\alpha_{ij} J_j \quad . \eeq The matrix elements
$\alpha_{ij}$ are hermitian since $J_i$'s are hermitian and they
commute with $J_i$'s but do not commute with each other. For the
transformed operators to obey the original relations, there should
exist some conditions on the $\alpha$'s which define the
invariance quantum group of the algebra. It is very convenient at
this moment to switch to an index notation that encompasses all
three defining relations of the algebra in one index equation. For
the angular momentum algebra this is possible by defining the
totally anti-symmetric rank 3 pseudo-tensor $\epsilon_{ijk}$. A
similar object for ACSA which we will call the fermionic
Levi-Civita tensor, $u_{ijk}$, is defined as: \beq u_{ijk} =
\left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
1, & i \neq j \neq k, \\
0, & \mbox{otherwise.}
\end{array}
\right. \eeq Thus the defining relations
(\ref{eqn:defrel1}-\ref{eqn:defrel3}) become: \beq \anti{J_i}{J_j}
= \sum_k  u_{ijk}\,J_k + 2\delta_{ij}\,J_i^2 \eeq The second term
on the right is needed since when $i = j$ the left-hand side
becomes $2J_i^2$. When we apply the transformation (\ref{trans})
on this relation we get: \beq \anti{J'_k}{J'_m} = \sum_p
u_{kmp}J'_p = \sum_{p,\; j}
u_{kmp}\,\alpha_{pj}\,J_j\quad\quad\mbox{for}\quad k\neq m. \eeq
However, substituting the transformation equations into the
left-hand side, we have: \beq \anti{J'_k}{J'_m} =
\sum_{i,\;j}\left([\alpha_{ki}, \alpha_{mj}]J_iJ_j +
\alpha_{mj}\,\alpha_{ki}\,u_{ijn}\,J_n +
2\alpha_{mj}\,\alpha_{kj}\,J_j^2\right) \eeq These two equations
yield the following relations among $\alpha_{ij}$ when $k\neq m$:
\bea
\anti{\alpha_{mj}}{\alpha_{kj}} & = & 0 \label{invrel1} \\
\left[\alpha_{ki}, \alpha_{mj}\right]& = & 0 \quad\quad \mbox{for}\quad i \neq j \label{invrel2} \\
\sum_{i\; j}\alpha_{mj}\,\alpha_{ki}\,u_{ijn}  & = & \sum_p
u_{mkp}\,\alpha_{pn} \label{invrel3} \eea

Now we will define the quantum group $SO_q(3)$ and show that the
relations above correspond to the case $q=-1$. The quantum group
$SO_q(3)$ can be defined as the quantum subgroup of $SL_q(3, C)$
where an element is given by: \beq A = \left(
\begin{array}{ccc}
\alpha_{11} & \alpha_{12} & \alpha_{13} \\
\alpha_{21} & \alpha_{22} & \alpha_{23} \\
\alpha_{31} & \alpha_{32} & \alpha_{33}
\end{array}
\right) \eeq where \beq \alpha_{ij}^* = \alpha_{ij} \eeq \beq A^T
= A^{-1} \eeq and \beq \label{gl2} \left(
\begin{array}{cc}
\alpha_{mj} & \alpha_{mi} \\
\alpha_{kj} & \alpha_{ki}
\end{array}
\right) \in GL_{q}(2)\quad\mbox{for}\quad k\neq m, i\neq j. \eeq

The quantum group $SO_q(3)$ is equivalent to the quantum group
\break\mbox{$SL_q(3, R) \cap SU_q(3)$}. However one can show for
$SL_q(3)$ that $q= e^{i\beta}$ for some $\beta \in R$ and
similarly for $SU_q(3)$ that $q \in R$. Thus one finds that $q =
\pm 1$ for $SO_q(3)$. When $q = 1$ the quantum group becomes the
usual $SO(3)$ group; the interesting case is when $q = -1$ which,
as we will show, is the invariance quantum group of ACSA.

Equations (\ref{invrel1}) and (\ref{invrel2}) are easily shown to
be satisfied by the matrix $A \in SO_{q=-1}(3)$ by recognizing
that the quantities involved belong to a submatrix that is an
element of $GL_{q=-1}(2)$, as in equation (\ref{gl2}). For a
general matrix $M \in GL_q(2)$ where:
\[
M = \left(
\begin{array}{cc}
a & b \\
c & d
\end{array}
\right)
\]
we have the relations: \bea
a c & = & q c a \label{ac} \\
a d - q b c & = & d a - q^{-1} c b \label{det} \\
b c & = & c b \label{bc} \eea The relation (\ref{ac}) implies that
$\alpha_{mj}\;\alpha_{kj} = (-1) \alpha_{kj}\;\alpha_{mj}$, which
proves equation (\ref{invrel1}) is satisfied, and the relations
(\ref{det}) and (\ref{bc}) show $ a d = d a$ for $q=-1$ which
implies $\alpha_{ki}\;\alpha_{mj} = \alpha_{mj}\;\alpha_{ki}$ thus
proving that equation (\ref{invrel2}) is satisfied by the elements
of an $SO_{q=-1}(3)$ matrix.

It is a little harder to show that equation (\ref{invrel3}) is
satisfied by elements of $SO_{q=-1}(3)$ matrices. However, if one
writes out the indices of the equation, one finds that equation
(\ref{invrel3}) implies that each matrix element is equal to the
$GL_{q=-1}(2)$-determinant of its minor. This fact is indeed
satisfied by $SO_{q=-1}(3)$ matrices since $\mathrm{det} A = 1$
and ${A^{-1}}^T = A$, one can show that $A = Co(A)$ which itself
means that every element is equal to the determinant of its minor.
Note that since $q = -1$, the cofactor of an element is always
equal to the minor without any alternation of signs. This type of
determinant with no alternation of signs is also called a
permanent.

Thus, we have found that the invariance quantum group of ACSA is
the quantum group $SO_q(3)$ with $q=-1$. Strictly speaking, ACSA
is a module of the $q$-deformed $SO(3)$ quantum algebra with $q =
-1$. It is very interesting to note that the invariance group of
the angular momentum algebra is also $SO_q(3)$ but with $q=1$.

\section{Representations}

The Anticommutator Spin Algebra is defined by the relations
(\ref{eqn:defrel1}-\ref{eqn:defrel3}). In order to find the
representations of this algebra we define the operators: \bea
J_+ & = & J_1 + J_2 \\
J_- & = & J_1 - J_2 \\
J^2 & = & J_1^2 + J_2^2 + J_3^2 \eea which obey the following
relations: \bea
\anti{J_+}{J_3} & = & J_3 \\
\anti{J_-}{J_3} & = & -J_3 \\
J_+^2 & = & J^2 - J_3^2 + J_3 \label{jp^2}\\
J_-^2 & = & J^2 - J_3^2 - J_3 \label{jm^2} \eea Furthermore, it
can easily be shown that $J^2$ is central in the algebra, ie that
it commutes with all the elements of the algebra. For this reason,
we can label the states in our representation with the eigenvalues
of $J^2$ and $J_3$: \bea
J^2 \ket{\lambda, \mu} & = & \lambda \ket{\lambda, \mu} \\
J_3 \ket{\lambda, \mu} & = & \mu \ket{\lambda, \mu} \eea The
action of $J_+$ and $J_-$ on the states such defined is easily
shown to be: \bea
J_+ \ket{\lambda, \mu} & = & f(\lambda, \mu) \ket{\lambda,- \mu + 1} \label{jplus}\\
J_- \ket{\lambda, \mu} & = & g(\lambda, \mu) \ket{\lambda,- \mu -
1} \label{jminus} \eea It is enough to look at the norm of the
states $J_+ \ket{\lambda, \mu}$ and $J_- \ket{\lambda, \mu}$ to
find $f(\lambda, \mu)$ and $g(\lambda, \mu)$. Thus: \bea
\bra{\lambda, \mu} J_+^2 \ket{\lambda, \mu} & = & |f(\lambda, \mu)|^2 \\
\bra{\lambda, \mu} J^2 - J_3^2 + J_3 \ket{\lambda, \mu} & = & |f(\lambda, \mu)|^2 \\
\lambda - \mu^2 + \mu & = & |f(\lambda, \mu)|^2 \\
f(\lambda, \mu) & = & \sqrt{\lambda - \mu^2 + \mu} \eea and,
similarly, $g(\lambda, \mu) = \sqrt{\lambda - \mu^2 - \mu}$. These
coefficients must be real due to the fact that $J_+$ and $J_-$ are
hermitian operators. This constraint imposes the following
conditions on $\lambda$ and $\mu$: \bea
\lambda - \mu^2 + \mu & \geq & 0 \\
\lambda - \mu^2 - \mu & \geq & 0 \eea which can be satisfied by
letting $\lambda = j(j+1)$ for some $j$ with: \beq j \geq \mu \geq
-j. \label{muspec} \eeq

Note that equation (\ref{jplus}) shows that the action of $J_+$ is
composed of a reflection which changes sign of $\mu$, the
eigenvalue of $J_3$, followed by raising by one unit. Similarly,
equation (\ref{jminus}) shows that $J_-$ reflects and lowers. Thus
the highest state $\mu = j$ is annihilated by $J_-$ and "lowered"
by $J_+$. Applying $J_+$ or $J_-$ twice to any state gives back
the same state due to relations (\ref{jp^2}) and (\ref{jm^2}).
Thus starting from the highest state we apply $J_-$ and $J_+$
alternately to get the spectrum: \beq j, -j+1, j-2, -j+3, ... \eeq
This sequence ends so as to satisfy equation (\ref{muspec}) only
for integer or half-integer $j$. For integer $j$, it terminates,
after an even number of steps, at $-j$ and visits every integer in
between only once. For half-integer $j=2k\pm\frac{1}{2}$ it ends
at $j=\pm\frac{1}{2}$ having visited only half the states with
$\mu$ half-odd integer between $j$ and $-j$. The rest of the
states cannot be reached from these but are obtained by starting
from the $\mu= -j$ state and applying $J_-$ and $J_+$ alternately;
starting with $J_-$.
\\
We now give a few examples:
\begin{itemize}
  \item
For $\mathbf{j=2}$ the states follow the sequence:
\[
\mathbf{\mu = 2, -1, 0, 1, -2}\quad.
\]
  \item
For $\mathbf{j=\frac{3}{2}}$ there exist two irreducible
representations one with:
\[
\mathbf{\mu = \frac{3}{2}, -\frac{1}{2}}\quad,
\] and the other with:
\[
\mathbf{\mu = -\frac{3}{2}, \frac{1}{2}}\quad.
\]

  \item
For $\mathbf{j=\frac{5}{2}}$ the two representations are given by:
\[
\mathbf{\mu = \frac{5}{2}, -\frac{3}{2}, \frac{1}{2}}\quad,
\] and by:
\[
\mathbf{\mu = -\frac{5}{2}, \frac{3}{2}, -\frac{1}{2}}\quad.
\]

\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusions}

The Anticommutator Spin Algebra, which is a special Jordan
algebra, has many implications. The first of these is the fact
that this algebra is a consistent fermionic algebra which is not a
superalgebra.
% The
%bosonic and fermionic generators $B, F$ in a superalgebra obey:
%\bea
%[B,B] & = & B \nonumber \\ \nonumber
%[F,B] & = & F \\ \nonumber
%\{F,F\} & = & B \nonumber
%\eea
%whereas in ACSA this relation is of the form:
%\[
%\{F,F\} = F
%\]
%which shows how different it is from a superalgebra.
For possible physical applications the right-hand side of the
defining relations (\ref{eqn:defrel1}-\ref{eqn:defrel3}) must also
be supplied with an $\hbar$. In a superalgebra approach where the
$J_i$ are regarded as odd operators, the $\hbar$ on the right-hand
side should also be regarded as an operator anticommuting with the
$J_i$. These models \cite{leites,batalin} result from the
quantization of the odd Poisson bracket. In our approach however,
the concept of grading and therefore an underlying Poisson bracket
formalism does not exist. In particular, there is no Jacobi
identity. Nevertheless, the associative algebra we consider is
consistent with quantum mechanics where physical observables
correspond to hermitian operators and their eigenvalues to
possible results of physical measurement of these observables. It
is for this reason that ACSA suggests a new kind of statistics
which, we believe, will be useful in physics.

The second implication is the important role of quantum groups in
mathematical physics. As we have shown in this paper, the
invariance group of ACSA turns out to be a quantum group. Given
the fact that ACSA is very similar to normal spin algebra and that
the invariance group of spin algebra plays an important role in
physics, the invariance quantum group of ACSA, $SO_{q=-1}(3)$,
becomes a prime example of how central quantum groups have become
in mathematical physics. It is also interesting to note that more
algebras like ACSA can be constructed where the commutators of the
original Lie algebra are turned into anticommutators and that such
algebras might also have invariance quantum groups that is the
same as the invariance group of the original Lie algebra with
$q=-1$. This possibility is open to investigation in a more
general framework.
